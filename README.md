Color Predictor with Brain.js
This is a trial website that uses a neural network to predict the appropriate color of a word based on its background color. The neural network is built using Brain.js, a JavaScript library for neural networks.

How It Works
Input: The neural network takes the RGB values of a background color as input.
Prediction: Based on the input, the neural network predicts the optimal RGB values for the text color to ensure good visibility and aesthetic appeal.
Output: The predicted text color is applied to the word displayed on the background color.
Features
Customizable: Experiment with different background colors to see how the neural network responds.
Powered by Brain.js: Utilizes a neural network trained with Brain.js to make color predictions.
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-predictor-brainjs.git
cd brainjs-trial
Open index.html in your web browser.

Refresh to load different random background colors and see the guess text change its color 

Technologies Used
Brain.js: For building and training the neural network.
HTML/CSS: For the website structure and styling.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic and interactivity.
